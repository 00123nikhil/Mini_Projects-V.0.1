# Mini_Projects-V.0.1
## Medical store billing system.

Welcome to my mini-projects V.0.1! This folder contains a collection of small coding projects that I have personally developed for the purpose of improving my coding skills and exploring new technologies.

Each project in this folder has a dedicated folder with a README file that contains a brief description of the project, as well as instructions.

I encourage to explore the projects in this folder and You are also welcome to contribute to these projects by submitting pull requests or reporting issues.

I believe that working on mini-projects is a great way to improve coding skills, and I hope that these projects will help us to becoming a better programmer. Thank you for your interest, happy coding!
